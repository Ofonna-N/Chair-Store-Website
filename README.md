# Second Website

---

Built a chair store website from this [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/pmr3UHzHBp37SsFFoZ4VmY/Elementor-Landing-Page?node-id=41%3A160) using only HTML and CSS.

Still in the process of biulding my skills with the markup and cascading languages
respectively. This site wasn't too difficult to build as my foundation in these
languages are pretty solid due to my extensive studying on both languages. The form reqiured a little bit more fine tuning but everything else was pretty straight forward thanks to the life saving flex box introduced by CSS.
